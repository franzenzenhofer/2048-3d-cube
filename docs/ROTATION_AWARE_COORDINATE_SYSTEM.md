# Rotation-Aware Coordinate System for 3D 2048

## üéØ The Ultimate Challenge

After each cube rotation, the concept of "up", "down", "left", and "right" changes for each face based on the cube's current orientation. This creates an incredibly complex and challenging gameplay experience.

## üß† Core Concept

Instead of each face having fixed directions, the directions are **relative to the current view**. When the cube rotates, what was "up" for a face might now be "left" or "right" or even "down"!

## üìê Mathematical Foundation

### Cube Orientation State

The cube can be in 24 different orientations (6 faces √ó 4 rotations per face). We track:
- **Current front face**: Which face is currently facing the player
- **Current up vector**: Which edge of the front face is pointing up

### Rotation Transformations

When the cube rotates, we need to transform the global swipe direction to each face's local coordinate system:

```
Global Swipe ‚Üí Cube Orientation ‚Üí Face Local Direction
```

## üéÆ Gameplay Impact

### Example Scenario

1. **Initial State**: FRONT face is facing you, with normal orientation
   - Swipe UP moves tiles up on all faces
   
2. **After RIGHT swipe**: LEFT face comes to front
   - What was the LEFT face's "right" is now facing up!
   - A swipe UP now moves tiles in what was originally the "right" direction for that face

3. **Complexity Multiplier**: Each of the 6 faces has a different transformation!

## üîÑ Rotation Mapping

### Face Orientation After Rotations

#### From FRONT Face Starting Position:

**Swipe RIGHT ‚Üí LEFT face becomes front**
- LEFT face's local axes:
  - Original UP ‚Üí Now points RIGHT (from viewer's perspective)
  - Original RIGHT ‚Üí Now points DOWN
  - Original DOWN ‚Üí Now points LEFT  
  - Original LEFT ‚Üí Now points UP

**Swipe LEFT ‚Üí RIGHT face becomes front**
- RIGHT face's local axes:
  - Original UP ‚Üí Now points LEFT
  - Original LEFT ‚Üí Now points DOWN
  - Original DOWN ‚Üí Now points RIGHT
  - Original RIGHT ‚Üí Now points UP

**Swipe UP ‚Üí BOTTOM face becomes front**
- BOTTOM face's local axes:
  - Original UP ‚Üí Now points AWAY (into screen)
  - Original DOWN ‚Üí Now points TOWARD (out of screen)
  - LEFT/RIGHT ‚Üí Remain same but inverted

**Swipe DOWN ‚Üí TOP face becomes front**
- TOP face's local axes:
  - Original UP ‚Üí Now points TOWARD (out of screen)
  - Original DOWN ‚Üí Now points AWAY (into screen)
  - LEFT/RIGHT ‚Üí Remain same

### The Back Face Challenge

The BACK face is particularly complex because it's always viewed "through" the cube:
- LEFT and RIGHT are naturally inverted
- After rotations, it compounds with additional transformations

## üéØ Implementation Strategy

### 1. Orientation Tracking

```typescript
interface CubeOrientation {
  frontFace: CubeFace;
  upVector: Vector3;  // Which direction is "up" for the cube
}
```

### 2. Direction Transformation Matrix

For each combination of:
- Current front face
- Current up vector  
- Target face
- Global swipe direction

We need a transformation that outputs the local movement direction.

### 3. Transformation Logic

```typescript
function getLocalDirection(
  face: CubeFace,
  globalSwipe: SwipeDirection,
  cubeOrientation: CubeOrientation
): SwipeDirection {
  // Complex transformation based on:
  // 1. Which face we're calculating for
  // 2. Current cube orientation
  // 3. The global swipe direction
  
  // This is a 24√ó6√ó4 = 576 possible combinations!
}
```

## üé≤ Gameplay Implications

### Mental Model Challenges

Players must maintain multiple mental models:

1. **Visual Model**: What they see on screen
2. **Spatial Model**: How faces relate in 3D space
3. **Temporal Model**: How orientations changed from rotations
4. **Predictive Model**: How the next swipe will affect each face

### Strategy Depth

- **Memory**: Remember the orientation of non-visible faces
- **Spatial Reasoning**: Understand 3D transformations
- **Planning**: Predict how moves affect differently-oriented faces
- **Adaptation**: Adjust strategy as orientation changes

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation Details

### Rotation Matrix Approach

Use 3D rotation matrices to transform directions:

```typescript
// Represent each swipe as a 3D vector
const swipeVectors = {
  UP: new Vector3(0, 1, 0),
  DOWN: new Vector3(0, -1, 0),
  LEFT: new Vector3(-1, 0, 0),
  RIGHT: new Vector3(1, 0, 0)
};

// Apply rotation matrices based on cube orientation
function transformSwipeVector(
  swipe: Vector3,
  faceRotation: Matrix4
): Vector3 {
  return swipe.clone().applyMatrix4(faceRotation);
}
```

### Face Normal Tracking

Each face has a normal vector and an up vector:

```typescript
interface FaceOrientation {
  normal: Vector3;    // Points outward from face
  up: Vector3;        // Points to top edge of face
  right: Vector3;     // Points to right edge of face
}
```

### Coordinate Space Conversion

1. **World Space**: The player's view
2. **Cube Space**: Relative to cube's current rotation
3. **Face Space**: Local to each face

## üéÆ Player Experience Considerations

### Difficulty Progression

1. **Beginner**: Show orientation hints
2. **Intermediate**: Reduce visual aids
3. **Expert**: No orientation indicators

### Visual Feedback

- **Orientation Indicator**: Show cube axes
- **Movement Preview**: Ghost tiles showing where pieces will move
- **Face Labels**: Dynamic labels showing current "up" for each face

### Learning Curve

This system creates an extremely steep learning curve:
- **Minute 1**: Complete confusion
- **Hour 1**: Beginning to grasp transformations
- **Day 1**: Developing spatial intuition
- **Week 1**: Mastering orientation tracking

## üöÄ Why This Is Revolutionary

1. **Cognitive Load**: Unprecedented mental challenge
2. **Skill Ceiling**: Nearly infinite room for improvement
3. **Unique Gameplay**: No other puzzle game has this mechanic
4. **Emergent Complexity**: Simple rules create deep gameplay

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Warnings

1. **Performance**: 576 transformation calculations per move
2. **Testing**: Each transformation needs verification
3. **Debugging**: Extremely difficult to debug orientation issues
4. **User Experience**: May be too complex for casual players

## üìä Complexity Comparison

| Game Version | Complexity | Mental Models | Accessibility |
|--------------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| Classic 2048 | Low | 1 (board) | High |
| 3D Independent | Medium | 6 (faces) | Medium |
| 3D Rotation-Aware | Extreme | 24+ (orientations) | Low |

## üéØ Conclusion

This rotation-aware system would create the most mentally challenging puzzle game ever made. Players would need to:
- Track 6 independent game states
- Understand 3D spatial transformations
- Predict outcomes across multiple coordinate systems
- Adapt to constantly changing orientations

It's beautiful in its mathematical elegance but brutal in its cognitive demands!
