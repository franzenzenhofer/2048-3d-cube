## Executive Summary

**3D 2048 is 6 independent 2048 games played simultaneously on the faces of a cube.**

The revolutionary concept: 
- Each face of the cube is a complete, independent 2048 game
- ALL six games respond to the SAME swipe direction simultaneously
- After each move, the cube rotates to show you a different face
- You're essentially playing 6 games at once with one set of controls

This creates a unique gameplay experience where:
- Every swipe affects 6 different game boards
- You must think about consequences across multiple games
- The rotating cube gives you glimpses of all your games in sequence
- Strategy involves managing 6 independent scores and game states

## The Fundamental Problem

### Traditional 2048 Mechanics
- 4x4 grid = 16 tiles
- 4 movement directions (up, down, left, right)
- All tiles visible simultaneously
- Movement affects entire rows/columns
- Merging happens in movement direction

### 3D Cube Challenges
1. **Visibility Problem**: A cube has 6 faces, but maximum 3 are visible
2. **Movement Ambiguity**: What does "swipe left" mean on a 3D object?
3. **Cross-Face Interaction**: How do tiles move between faces?
4. **Orientation Confusion**: Player loses track of which face is which
5. **Strategic Impossibility**: Can't plan moves without seeing all tiles

## Mathematical Foundation

### Topology of a Cube
```
      [T]
   [L][F][R][B]
      [b]

T = Top, b = Bottom, L = Left, R = Right, F = Front, B = Back
```

### Movement Vectors in 3D Space
- Each face has local 2D coordinates
- Global movement must map to local face movements
- Edge transitions create discontinuities

### The Edge Problem
When a tile reaches an edge:
1. **Wrap Around**: Tile appears on opposite edge (breaks cube topology)
2. **Stop at Edge**: No cross-face movement (limits gameplay)
3. **Face Transition**: Tile moves to adjacent face (complex rules needed)

## Visual Design Constraints

### Above-the-Fold Requirement
- Screen height: ~600-800px on mobile
- Must show: entire game, score, controls hint
- No scrolling allowed

### Visibility Requirements
- All numbers must be readable
- Active tiles must be distinguishable
- Movement must be trackable
- 3D depth must be perceivable

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Unfolded Cube (Cross Pattern)
```
    [T]
[L][F][R][B]
    [b]
```
**Pros:**
- All faces visible
- Clear adjacency relationships
- Maintains topological correctness

**Cons:**
- Not truly 3D
- Large screen space required
- Loses 3D appeal

### Solution 2: Rotating Cube with Memory
- Show 3 faces at a time
- Rotate to reveal hidden faces
- Display mini-map of all faces

**Pros:**
- True 3D experience
- Fits in viewport
- Maintains cube aesthetic

**Cons:**
- Can't see all tiles
- Requires mental mapping
- Slow gameplay

### Solution 3: Transparent Cube with Layers
- Make cube semi-transparent
- Show all faces with opacity layers
- Near faces more opaque

**Pros:**
- All tiles visible
- True 3D object
- Unique visual style

**Cons:**
- Visual clutter
- Depth perception issues
- Number readability problems

### Solution 4: Isometric Projection
- Show cube at specific angle
- All 6 faces partially visible
- Each face is a rhombus

**Pros:**
- All faces visible
- Clear 3D representation
- Fits above fold

**Cons:**
- Distorted tile shapes
- Harder to read numbers
- Non-intuitive controls

### Solution 5: Inside-Out Cube
- Player is "inside" the cube
- Look around to see all faces
- Faces curve inward

**Pros:**
- All faces potentially visible
- Unique perspective
- Immersive experience

**Cons:**
- Disorienting
- Requires constant view changes
- Motion sickness potential

## The Chosen Approach: Hybrid Isometric with Smart Rotation

After extensive analysis, the optimal solution combines:

1. **Isometric Base View**: Shows 3 primary faces clearly
2. **Smart Auto-Rotation**: Cube rotates to show relevant faces after moves
3. **Predictive Display**: Highlight tiles that will be affected
4. **Edge Indicators**: Visual cues for cross-face movements

### Mathematical Model

#### Face Coordinate System
Each face has coordinates (0,0) to (3,3):
```
Face = {
  id: 'front' | 'back' | 'left' | 'right' | 'top' | 'bottom',
  tiles: [4][4]
}
```

#### Movement Rules
1. **Intra-face**: Standard 2048 movement within a face
2. **Inter-face**: Tiles crossing edges follow strict mapping:
   ```
   Front-Right Edge → Right-Left Edge
   Front-Top Edge → Top-Bottom Edge
   etc.
   ```

#### Rotation Algorithm
```
After move in direction D:
1. Calculate affected faces
2. Determine optimal viewing angle
3. Rotate to show maximum merged tiles
4. Ease rotation over 500ms
```

### Visual Hierarchy

1. **Primary Layer**: Currently active face (100% opacity)
2. **Secondary Layer**: Adjacent faces (70% opacity)
3. **Tertiary Layer**: Opposite face (40% opacity)
4. **Numbers**: High contrast, always readable
5. **Merge Effects**: Glow propagates across faces

## Implementation Details

### Tile Movement Physics
```typescript
interface Movement {
  sourceFace: Face;
  targetFace: Face;
  sourcePos: [number, number];
  targetPos: [number, number];
  value: number;
}

function moveAcrossFaces(movement: Movement): void {
  // Calculate path across edge
  // Apply rotation transformation
  // Merge if applicable
}
```

### Swipe Interpretation: The Critical Design Decision

This is perhaps the most important aspect of the game. When does a swipe move tiles, and when does it rotate the cube?

#### Option 1: Context-Sensitive Swipes
- **Single Tap + Swipe**: Move tiles on current face
- **Long Press + Swipe**: Rotate cube
- **Problem**: Too complex, not discoverable

#### Option 2: Dedicated Zones
- **Center 80% of screen**: Swipe moves tiles
- **Edge 20% of screen**: Swipe rotates cube
- **Problem**: Accidental rotations, frustrating

#### Option 3: Two-Phase Gameplay (REJECTED)
- **Phase 1**: Make moves on visible faces
- **Phase 2**: Rotate to new position
- **Problem**: Breaks flow, feels clunky

#### Option 4: Pure Tile Movement (CHOSEN SOLUTION) ⭐

**ALL swipes ALWAYS move tiles, NEVER rotate the cube manually.**

Here's why this is revolutionary:

1. **Automatic Smart Rotation**: After each tile movement, the cube automatically rotates to show the most relevant faces based on:
   - Where new tiles appeared
   - Where merges happened
   - Where the next strategic moves are likely

2. **Movement Logic Across Faces**:
   ```
   When swiping LEFT on the front face:
   - Tiles move left within the front face
   - Tiles at the left edge continue onto the LEFT FACE
   - The cube then rotates to show both affected faces
   ```

3. **The 6-Direction Model**:
   Instead of 4 directions, we have 6 cube-relative directions:
   - **Left/Right**: Horizontal movement around the cube's equator
   - **Up/Down**: Vertical movement over the cube's poles  
   - **In/Out**: Z-axis movement (special gesture: two-finger swipe)

4. **Example Scenarios**:
   ```
   Scenario A: Swipe left on front face
   - Front face tiles slide left
   - Leftmost tiles wrap to left face's rightmost column
   - Cube rotates 45° to show both faces
   
   Scenario B: Swipe up on any face
   - Face tiles slide up  
   - Top row tiles move to the TOP face
   - Cube tilts to show the transition
   
   Scenario C: Two-finger swipe in
   - Tiles move "through" the cube
   - Front face tiles push to back face
   - Cube becomes temporarily transparent
   ```

5. **Movement Continuity**:
   The key insight is that the cube is treated as a continuous surface:
   ```
   [Back] ← [Left] ← [Front] → [Right] → [Back]
            ↑         ↓
          [Top]   [Bottom]
   ```

6. **Visual Feedback**:
   - **Pre-movement**: Ghost tiles show where pieces will go
   - **During movement**: Tiles follow paths across edges
   - **Post-movement**: Smooth rotation to optimal viewing angle

#### Why This Works

1. **Simplicity**: One action type (swipe) = one result type (move)
2. **Predictability**: Players always know what swipes do
3. **Discovery**: Automatic rotations teach face relationships
4. **Flow**: No mode switching or complex gestures
5. **Strategy**: Must think in 3D from the start

#### Edge Case Handling

When tiles cross face boundaries:
1. **Priority Rule**: Merges happen on the destination face
2. **Cascade Effect**: One move can affect up to 3 faces
3. **Scoring Bonus**: Cross-face merges worth extra points
4. **Visual Trail**: Glowing path shows tile movement

#### The Magic Formula

```
Optimal View Angle = f(
  affected_faces_count,
  merge_locations,
  empty_space_distribution,
  previous_view_angle
)
```

The cube always rotates to maximize:
1. Visibility of merged tiles
2. Number of visible empty spaces
3. Strategic options for next move

### Scoring System
- Same as 2048 for intra-face merges
- 2x bonus for inter-face merges
- 3x bonus for triple-face combos

## User Experience Considerations

### Learning Curve
1. **Tutorial Mode**: Start with single face
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Unlock faces as score increases
3. **Visual Hints**: Show movement previews
4. **Undo Option**: Allow one undo per game

### Mobile Optimization
- **Viewport**: Fixed at 100vh, no scroll
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px
- **Gestures**: Natural and responsive
- **Performance**: 60fps on mid-range devices

### Accessibility
- **High Contrast Mode**: Pure white on black
- **Number Size**: Minimum 16px, scales with tile
- **Animation Toggle**: Disable rotations
- **Sound Cues**: Optional audio feedback

## Review: Alexey Pajitnov's Perspective

*As the creator of Tetris, I evaluate games through the lens of simplicity, immediate understanding, and addictive gameplay.*

### What Works
1. **Single Input Method**: Like Tetris's rotate/move/drop, this game has only swipes. Perfect.
2. **Automatic Rotation**: Brilliant! The game shows you what you need to see, when you need to see it.
3. **Continuous Surface**: Treating the cube as one connected playfield is elegant.

### Concerns
1. **Cognitive Load**: Tracking 6 faces vs Tetris's single playfield is 6x complexity
2. **Learning Curve**: Will players understand cross-face movement immediately?
3. **Visual Clarity**: Can players form strategies when they can't see all tiles?

### Pajitnov's Verdict
"The automatic rotation is genius - it solves the 3D visibility problem elegantly. However, I would simplify further:
- Start with just 3 faces (front, left, right) unlocked
- Add faces as players demonstrate mastery
- Make cross-face movement more visually dramatic with trails"

**Rating: 8/10** - Innovative but needs progressive complexity

## Review: Mathematical Analysis

*From a pure mathematics perspective, examining topology, game theory, and computational complexity.*

### Topological Correctness
The cube mapping is topologically sound:
```
Face Adjacency Graph:
- Each face connects to exactly 4 others
- Opposite faces never connect directly  
- Movement paths form a consistent manifold
```

### Game Theory Analysis
1. **State Space**: 6 * 4^4 = 1,536 cells vs 16 in original
2. **Branching Factor**: 6 directions vs 4 (50% increase)
3. **Strategy Depth**: Exponentially more complex due to hidden information

### Mathematical Elegance
The movement formula is beautiful:
```
Position(t+1) = Position(t) + Direction × Distance
If Position(t+1) ∉ CurrentFace:
    [Face', Position'] = FaceTransition(Position(t+1))
```

### Optimal Strategy Existence
Unlike 2048, perfect play is impossible due to:
1. **Incomplete Information**: Can't see all faces
2. **Cascading Effects**: Moves affect multiple faces
3. **Rotation Uncertainty**: Can't predict exact viewing angle

### Mathematical Verdict
"This transforms 2048 from a solved game to an unsolvable one. The cross-face mechanics create emergent complexity that's mathematically fascinating. The scoring system should reward high-difficulty merges:

Score = BaseMerge × (1 + 0.5 × FacesCrossed) × (1 + 0.25 × ChainLength)"

**Rating: 9/10** - Mathematically rich and unexplored

## Final Design Decision

Based on both reviews, the implementation will:

1. **Progressive Complexity**: 
   - Start with 3 faces (front, left, right)
   - Unlock top at 512 points
   - Unlock bottom at 2048 points
   - Unlock back at 8192 points

2. **Visual Enhancements**:
   - Glowing trails for cross-face movement
   - Predictive ghosts before swipes
   - Particle effects at merge points

3. **Mathematical Scoring**:
   ```typescript
   score = baseMerge * (1 + 0.5 * facesCrossed) * (1 + 0.25 * chainLength)
   ```

4. **Tutorial Integration**:
   - First 3 moves are guided
   - Show trail preview before confirming
   - Highlight affected faces

## Conclusion

The optimal 3D 2048 implementation:
1. Uses isometric projection for simultaneous face visibility
2. Implements smart rotation to show relevant tiles
3. Maintains clear number visibility at all times
4. Fits entirely above the fold
5. Provides intuitive swipe controls
6. Preserves strategic depth while adding 3D complexity

This approach balances the mathematical purity of 2048 with the visual appeal of 3D, creating a game that is both playable and innovative.
